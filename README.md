## VovemDev-Workstation

Contributing to a workstation involves a series of steps that are required to be followed to ensure that the contribution is made effectively and efficiently. In this documentation, we will explain the process of contributing to a workstation in detail. We will also provide citations for each project inside the workstation and explain the utilities that are available in the workstation.

Step-by-Step Guide to Contributing to a Workstation:

The following are the steps that you need to follow to contribute to a workstation:

# Step 1: Identify the area of contribution:
Before you start contributing to the workstation, you need to identify the area where you can contribute. The workstation may have multiple projects, and each project may require different skills and expertise. Therefore, it is important to identify the project that matches your skillset.

# Step 2: Familiarize yourself with the project:
Once you have identified the project, you need to familiarize yourself with the project. Read the project documentation, go through the codebase, and understand the project requirements. This will help you in understanding the project better and contribute effectively.

# Step 3: Join the community:
Most workstations have a community of contributors. Joining the community will help you in interacting with other contributors, learning from their experiences, and getting help when you need it.

# Step 4: Choose a task to work on:
After joining the community and understanding the project requirements, you need to choose a task to work on. This can be done by going through the project issues, discussing with other contributors, or proposing a new feature.

# Step 5: Discuss the task with the community:
Before you start working on the task, it is important to discuss the task with the community. This will help you in understanding the requirements of the task, getting feedback on your approach, and avoiding duplication of work.

# Step 6: Work on the task:
Once you have discussed the task with the community, you can start working on the task. Make sure to follow the coding standards and conventions followed by the project, and keep the code clean and maintainable.

# Step 7: Submit a pull request:
After completing the task, submit a pull request to the project. Make sure to provide a clear and concise description of the changes made and the reason for the changes.

# Step 8: Address feedback:
The pull request may receive feedback from other contributors or project maintainers. Address the feedback and make the necessary changes.

# Step 9: Get the pull request merged:
Once the feedback has been addressed, the pull request can be merged into the project.

Citation of Projects in the Workstation:

The workstation may have multiple projects, each serving a specific purpose. The following are some of the projects that can be found in a typical workstation:

TensorFlow:
TensorFlow is an open-source machine learning framework developed by Google. It allows developers to build and train machine learning models, and deploy them in production environments.
